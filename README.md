# robot_emblem
A ROS 2 demo package inspired by *Fire Emblem*-style grid maps.   This project builds a simple **grid-based map** with three terrain types (`free`, `tree`, `ice`),   renders it in RViz using `MarkerArray`, and adds grid lines for clarity.   It is the foundation for later adding units, movement, and RPG logic.

### Day 2

- Implemented a simple movement logic.  
- Used RVizâ€™s **Publish Point** tool to publish clicked points.  
- Subscribed to these points to update relative position.  
- The robot now moves one grid closer to the target each step, simulating basic movement.

### Day 3

- Replaced the placeholder marker with a simple **URDF-based robot model**.  
- Integrated the model into RViz through `robot_state_publisher`.  
- The robot model now follows the same grid-based movement logic, providing a more intuitive visualization.

- Prevent diagonal movement (grid-based Manhattan steps only) 
- Add visualization of reachable area using BFS and marker array
- Next: refine movement logic, add turn-based system, and support turn state rollback"

- Added a second model (enemy unit) and verified that both the ally and enemy models can be spawned in RViz with distinct prefixes (ally/ and enemy/).

- Extended the UnitManagerNode logic:

    - Units are now stored in a vector, allowing multiple robots to be managed at once.

    - Each unit has its own frame (ally/base_link, enemy/base_link) and marker color (yellow for ally, red for enemy).

- Began introducing the turn-based concept:

    - Prototype currently only allows the ally unit to move when a point is clicked.

    - The enemy unit is present in the world but does not yet act during its turn.

    - This sets the foundation for alternating Player and Enemy phases in future iterations.
