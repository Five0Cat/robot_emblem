# robot_emblem
A ROS 2 demo package inspired by *Fire Emblem*-style grid maps.   This project builds a simple **grid-based map** with three terrain types (`free`, `tree`, `ice`),   renders it in RViz using `MarkerArray`, and adds grid lines for clarity.   It is the foundation for later adding units, movement, and RPG logic.

### Day 2
- Implemented a simple movement logic.  
- Used RVizâ€™s **Publish Point** tool to publish clicked points.  
- Subscribed to these points to update relative position.  
- The robot now moves one grid closer to the target each step, simulating basic movement.

### Day 3
- Replaced the placeholder marker with a simple **URDF-based robot model**.  
- Integrated the model into RViz through `robot_state_publisher`.  
- The robot model now follows the same grid-based movement logic, providing a more intuitive visualization.
