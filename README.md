# robot_emblem
A ROS 2 demo package inspired by *Fire Emblem*-style grid maps.   This project builds a simple **grid-based map** with three terrain types (`free`, `tree`, `ice`),   renders it in RViz using `MarkerArray`, and adds grid lines for clarity.   It is the foundation for later adding units, movement, and RPG logic.
